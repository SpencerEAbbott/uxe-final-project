Introduction to UX Engineering Night Class Final Project
===================================================

The purpose of our final project was to create a static page using the sum total of everything we have learned. Requirements were some what loose, as our instructor wanted us to use our discernment for what we would spend the most time on. 

Our instructions were to replicate an image of a web pate as best as possible. Once we had completed that, we were to implement useful JQuery on the site. 
[Here is the image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerEAbbott/uxe-final-project/master/Example-Site-To-Replicate.jpg "Here is the image we were told to replicate").

My Focus
--------

There were several things I wanted to make sure I implemented on the page. Here are some highlights:
* Semantic HTML
* Modular CSS utilizing concepts from SMACCS
* Icon Fonts
* Best Practices for small file size of images
* Responsive design from desktop to mobile
* Utilizing JQuery in practical and a beatuful way

How to view my project
-----------------------

To view the site, clone this repo to your desktop. I encourage you to do two things evaluating:
1. A/B my site compared to the jpeg example[ was instructed to replicate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerEAbbott/uxe-final-project/master/Example-Site-To-Replicate.jpg "Here is the image we were told to replicate").
2. Review my code on github. 


Thanks for taking a look!
