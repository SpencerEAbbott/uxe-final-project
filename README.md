Introduction to UX Engineering Night Class Final Project
===================================================

The purpose of our final project was to create a static page using the sum total of everything we have learned. Requirements were some what loose, as our instructor wanted us to use our discernment for what we would spend the most time on. 

Our instructions were to replicate an image of a web pate as best as possible. Once we had completed that, we were to implement useful JQuery on the site. 
[Here is the image](http://example.com/ "Here is the image we were told to replicate").

* Semantic HTML
* Modular CSS utilizing concepts from SMACCS
* Icon Fonts
